Coconut Farming Guide

  1. Crop Season:
   - Planting: Best during the monsoon season (June to September) when the soil has ample moisture.

  2. Fertilizers:
   - Organic Manure: 20-50 kg/tree/year.
   - NPK: 500 g nitrogen (N), 320 g phosphorus (P2O5), and 1200 g potassium (K2O) per tree per year.
   - Micro-nutrients: Magnesium, zinc, and boron as needed based on soil tests.

  3. Seed Types:
   - Tall Varieties: West Coast Tall, East Coast Tall.
   - Dwarf Varieties: Chowghat Dwarf Green, Chowghat Dwarf Orange.
   - Hybrid Varieties: T x D (Tall x Dwarf) hybrids like Kera Sree, Anakkara Tall x Gangabondam Green Dwarf.

  4. Soil Type and Nutrients:
   - Soil Type: Well-drained sandy loam, alluvial, or red loam soils.
   - Nutrients: Rich in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micro-nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and boron.

  5. Soil pH:
   - Ideal pH range: 5.5 - 7.5.

  6. Steps to Grow Coconut:
   1. Site Selection and Preparation:
      - Select a site with good drainage and exposure to sunlight.
      - Prepare the soil by digging pits of size 1m x 1m x 1m.

   2. Planting:
      - Space the pits 7.5m x 7.5m apart for tall varieties and 6.5m x 6.5m for dwarf varieties.
      - Plant the seedlings at the beginning of the monsoon.

   3. Water Management:
      - Water the plants regularly, especially during the dry season.
      - Use drip irrigation to ensure efficient water use.

   4. Weed Management:
      - Regularly remove weeds manually or with the use of herbicides.

   5. Fertilizer Application:
      - Apply organic manure and NPK fertilizers as per recommended doses.

   6. Pest and Disease Management:
      - Monitor and control pests (e.g., rhinoceros beetle, red palm weevil) using integrated pest management (IPM) practices.
      - Treat diseases (e.g., bud rot, leaf blight) with appropriate fungicides and cultural practices.

   7. Harvesting:
      - Harvest when the nuts are mature, typically 10-12 months after flowering.

  7. Methods to Improve Yield:
   - Use high-yielding or hybrid varieties.
   - Ensure balanced fertilization.
   - Practice integrated pest management (IPM).
   - Adopt improved water management techniques like drip irrigation.

  8. Irrigation Techniques:
   - Drip Irrigation: Efficient water use and better growth.
   - Basin Irrigation: Suitable for areas with ample water supply.

  9. Common Pests and Management:
   - Rhinoceros Beetle: Use pheromone traps, biological control (e.g., Baculovirus), and mechanical removal.
   - Red Palm Weevil: Pheromone traps, biological control (e.g., entomopathogenic fungi), and insecticides.

  10. Common Weeds and Management:
   - Manual weeding or use of herbicides as necessary.

  11. Storage Methods:
   - Store harvested nuts in a cool, dry place.
   - Ensure proper ventilation to prevent mold and spoilage.

  12. Dealing with Unfavorable Climate:
   - Drought: Use drought-resistant varieties, mulching, and efficient water management.
   - Flood: Ensure proper drainage, use flood-tolerant varieties.
   - Cyclone: Provide windbreaks, proper staking, and support to young palms.
