1. Preparation
a. Land Selection
Choose a flat area with clay or loamy soil.
Ensure the land has good water retention capabilities.
b. Seed Selection
Use high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties suitable for your climate.
Certified seeds are recommended for better results.
c. Land Preparation
Clear the land of weeds and debris.
Plow the field to a fine tilth.
Level the field to ensure uniform water distribution.
d. Seedbed Preparation
Prepare a nursery bed for raising seedlings.
Use well-decomposed manure or compost.
2. Sowing
a. Seed Treatment
Soak seeds in water for 24 hours.
Treat seeds with fungicide to prevent seed-borne diseases.
b. Nursery Bed
Sow seeds in the nursery bed 25-30 days before transplanting.
Maintain adequate moisture in the nursery bed.
3. Transplanting
a. Timing
Transplant seedlings when they are 20-30 days old.
Best time for transplanting is in the early morning or late afternoon.
b. Spacing
Use a spacing of 20x15 cm or 20x20 cm between plants.
Plant 2-3 seedlings per hill.
4. Water Management
a. Irrigation
Maintain 2-5 cm of standing water during the initial growth stages.
Drain water before applying fertilizers and then re-flood the field.
Reduce water levels during the grain filling stage.
5. Nutrient Management
a. Fertilizers
Apply basal dose of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium before transplanting.
Top dress with nitrogen at tillering and panicle initiation stages.
b. Organic Manure
Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost into the soil.
6. Weed Management
a. Manual Weeding
Hand weed 20-30 days after transplanting and again at 40-50 days.
Use tools like a rotary weeder for efficiency.
b. Chemical Weeding
Apply pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides as needed.
7. Pest and Disease Management
a. Common Pests
Monitor for pests like rice stem borers, leafhoppers, and planthoppers.
Use insecticides as recommended by agricultural extension services.
b. Common Diseases
Watch for diseases like rice blast, sheath blight, and bacterial blight.
Use fungicides and disease-resistant varieties.
8. Harvesting
a. Timing
Harvest when grains are 80-90% mature and golden yellow.
Typically, this is 30-35 days after flowering.
b. Method
Cut the plants at the base using a sickle.
Thresh the harvested plants to separate grains from straw.
9. Post-Harvest Management
a. Drying
Sun-dry the grains to reduce moisture content to 12-14%.
Use mechanical dryers if available.
b. Storage
Store grains in a cool, dry place.
Use airtight containers to protect against pests and moisture.
c. Milling
Process grains to remove husk and bran layers.
Ensure proper milling to maintain grain quality.
