Jute Farming Guide

  1. Crop Season:
   - Sowing: Best during the monsoon season (April to May).
   - Harvesting: Typically done 120-150 days after sowing (August to September).

  2. Fertilizers:
   - Nitrogen (N): 60-80 kg/ha (applied in splits - basal and at 3-4 weeks after sowing).
   - Phosphorus (P2O5): 30-40 kg/ha (basal application).
   - Potassium (K2O): 40-50 kg/ha (basal application).
   - Zinc Sulfate: 25 kg/ha (if zinc deficiency is observed).

  3. Seed Types:
   - Capsularis (White Jute): JRC 321, JRC 212, JRC 7447.
   - Olitorius (Tossa Jute): JRO 8432, JRO 204, JRO 524.

  4. Soil Type and Nutrients:
   - Soil Type: Well-drained loamy, sandy loam, or clay loam soils.
   - Nutrients: Rich in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micro-nutrients like zinc and iron.

  5. Soil pH:
   - Ideal pH range: 5.0 - 6.8.

  6. Steps to Grow Jute:
   1. Field Preparation:
      - Plow the field thoroughly and prepare a fine seedbed.
      - Apply basal fertilizers as recommended.

   2. Sowing:
      - Sow seeds at a depth of 2-3 cm.
      - Maintain a spacing of 30-40 cm between rows.

   3. Water Management:
      - Ensure regular watering, especially during the early growth stages.
      - Avoid waterlogging as jute is sensitive to excess water.

   4. Weed Management:
      - Manual weeding or use of pre-emergence herbicides (e.g., Pendimethalin).

   5. Fertilizer Application:
      - Apply nitrogen in splits to ensure proper growth and development.

   6. Pest and Disease Management:
      - Monitor and control pests (e.g., jute stem weevil, jute hairy caterpillar) using integrated pest management (IPM) practices.
      - Treat diseases (e.g., stem rot, black band) with appropriate fungicides and cultural practices.

   7. Harvesting:
      - Harvest when the plants start shedding leaves and the base of the stem turns yellow (typically 120-150 days after sowing).

  7. Methods to Improve Yield:
   - Use high-yielding or improved varieties.
   - Ensure balanced fertilization.
   - Practice integrated pest management (IPM).
   - Use improved water management techniques.

  8. Irrigation Techniques:
   - Flood Irrigation: Commonly used for jute fields.
   - Furrow Irrigation: Suitable for fields with good drainage.

  9. Common Pests and Management:
   - Jute Stem Weevil: Use pheromone traps, biological control (e.g., parasitoids), and insecticides.
   - Jute Hairy Caterpillar: Monitor regularly, use light traps, and apply insecticides if necessary.

  10. Common Weeds and Management:
   - Manual weeding or use of herbicides as necessary.

  11. Storage Methods:
   - Ret the harvested jute stems in water for 15-20 days to extract the fibers.
   - Dry the fibers properly before storing.
   - Store in a cool, dry place with proper ventilation to prevent mold and spoilage.

  12. Dealing with Unfavorable Climate:
   - Drought: Use drought-resistant varieties, adopt mulching, and efficient water management.
   - Flood: Ensure proper drainage, use flood-tolerant varieties.
   - Cold: Use cold-tolerant varieties, adjust planting dates to avoid peak cold periods.
   - Heat: Use heat-tolerant varieties, adjust planting dates to avoid peak heat periods.
