Rice Farming Guide

  1. Crop Season:
   - Kharif (Monsoon) Season: Sown in June-July and harvested in September-October.
   - Rabi Season: Sown in November-December and harvested in March-April.
   - Summer Season: Sown in January-February and harvested in April-May.

  2. Fertilizers:
   - Nitrogen (N): 60-120 kg/ha (applied in splits - at transplanting, tillering, and panicle initiation).
   - Phosphorus (P2O5): 30-60 kg/ha (basal application).
   - Potassium (K2O): 30-60 kg/ha (basal application).
   - Zinc Sulfate: 25 kg/ha (if zinc deficiency is observed).

  3. Seed Types:
   - High-Yielding Varieties (HYV): IR64, Swarna, MTU1010.
   - Hybrid Varieties: PHB71, KRH-2.
   - Traditional Varieties: Basmati, Sona Masuri.

  4. Soil Type and Nutrients:
   - Soil Type: Loamy, clayey loam, or silty loam soils with good water retention.
   - Nutrients: Rich in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micro-nutrients like zinc and iron.

  5. Soil pH:
   - Ideal pH range: 5.5 - 6.5.

  6. Steps to Grow Rice:
   1. Seed Selection and Treatment:
      - Select high-quality seeds.
      - Treat seeds with fungicide (e.g., Carbendazim) to prevent seed-borne diseases.

   2. Nursery Preparation:
      - Prepare nursery beds.
      - Sow seeds densely in the nursery.

   3. Field Preparation:
      - Plow and puddle the field.
      - Level the field for uniform water distribution.

   4. Transplanting:
      - Transplant 20-25 days old seedlings from the nursery to the main field.
      - Maintain a spacing of 20x15 cm.

   5. Water Management:
      - Keep the field flooded with 2-5 cm of water during the vegetative stage.
      - Drain water 10-15 days before harvest.

   6. Weed Management:
      - Manual weeding or use of herbicides (e.g., Butachlor, Pretilachlor).

   7. Fertilizer Application:
      - Apply fertilizers as per recommended doses and timing.

   8. Pest and Disease Management:
      - Monitor and control pests (e.g., stem borer, leaf folder) using integrated pest management (IPM) practices.
      - Treat diseases (e.g., blast, bacterial leaf blight) with appropriate fungicides and bactericides.

   9. Harvesting:
      - Harvest when grains are fully matured and have 20-25% moisture content.

  7. Methods to Improve Yield:
   - Use high-yielding or hybrid varieties.
   - Adopt System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technique.
   - Ensure balanced fertilization.
   - Practice integrated pest management (IPM).
   - Use improved water management techniques.

  8. Irrigation Techniques:
   - Flood Irrigation: Commonly used in rice paddies.
   - Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD): To save water and improve yield.
   - Drip Irrigation: Not commonly used but can be adapted in water-scarce areas.

  9. Common Pests and Management:
   - Stem Borer: Use pheromone traps, biological control (Trichogramma), and insecticides.
   - Leaf Folder: Biological control (parasitoids), light traps, and insecticides.
   - Brown Planthopper: Use resistant varieties, reduce nitrogenous fertilizers, and apply insecticides.

  10. Common Weeds and Management:
   - Echinochloa spp. (Barnyard Grass): Manual weeding, herbicides (Butachlor).
   - Cyperus spp. (Sedges): Herbicides (2,4-D).

  11. Storage Methods:
   - Dry grains to 12-14% moisture content.
   - Store in airtight containers or bags.
   - Use insecticides or fumigants to protect from storage pests.

  12. Dealing with Unfavorable Climate:
   - Drought: Use drought-resistant varieties, adopt AWD irrigation, mulching.
   - Flood: Use flood-tolerant varieties, proper field drainage.
   - Cold: Use cold-tolerant varieties, adjust planting dates to avoid peak cold periods.
   - Heat: Use heat-tolerant varieties, adjust planting dates to avoid peak heat periods.
